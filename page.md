Ockham is a platform for publishing collaborative research in the humanities
built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Beginning with Jekyll, Twitter Bootstrap, and GitHub we are building a static
site publishing platform for humanities research. The goal is to keep it
simple. No CMS, no elaborate back-end administration, just content managed
directly by the scholars who create it.

By design, content and formatting are kept separate, while making the
maintaining and updating information easy for individuals without knowledge of
(or interest in) HTML. We seek to make this happen by integrating cloud file
shares and possibly Gists.
